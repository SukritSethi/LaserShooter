The current issue, I'm too lazy to inculcate a touchscreen control system and I don't intend to do so in the foreseeable future, so no android file. If u for some reason want to install a zip file made by an unkown person and run an Application, just make sure to correct the aspect ratio to somewhere near 9:16

Till then,
